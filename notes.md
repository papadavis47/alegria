<span class="block">What makes me happy</span>
<span class="block">What inspires me?</span>
<span class="block">What am I grateful for?</span>
<span class="block">What do I dream about?</span>
<span class="block">Where do I want to go?</span>
```

Maybe use the phrase: "Keep moving forward" - in place of "Remember the important things"

Just an idea. We'll see.
